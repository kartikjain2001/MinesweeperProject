# Minesweeper Game 

Minesweeper is one of those all time games which were available on all computer devices and were always a way to pass time while clicking random blocks and trying not to step on the mine ☠️.

## Rules for the game

Rules to play a minesweeper game were simply ➡️➡️➡️➡️ *Do no click a block containing a mine* ⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️. But, there were all different things to help the player get hints of knowing where the mine can be.

* When a player used to click a mine, there will be some mines which have numbers ranging fron 1 to 8 on them, these numbers represented the number of mines adjacent to that block. As there are only 8 adjacent / neighbouring blocks, there can be atmost 8 mines surrounding a block. These numbers helpes the user to decide the next move.

* Sometimes flags are also given to the user, these are also for the user to keep track of all the possible places where the mines can be. So that the flagged blocks reminds him of the situation.
